# PanoFlow
The implementaions of [PanoFlow: Learning Optical Flow for Panoramic Images](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.13388.pdf). 
We achieve state-of-the-art accuracy on the public OmniFlowNet dataset and the proposed Flow360 dataset.
This repository is built on the basis of [CSFlow](https://github.com/MasterHow/CSFlow).

# Flow360 Datset
![](results/Flow360.png)
From left to right: overlapping image pairs, optical flow, and semantics. 
Flow360 dataset consists of 8 various city maps in four weathers: 
sunny, fog, cloud, and rain. 
We collect 100 consecutive panoramic images at each random position, 
resulting in a total of 6,400 frames with a resolution of 1024 x 512 , 
each with optical flow ground truth and semantic labels, 
which can be used for training and evaluation. 
Since the flow field of panoramic images usually contains large displacement that interferes with visualization and fades colors, 
we modified the visualization method of optical flow, 
and lowered the color saturation of optical flow greater than the threshold.

```
better_flow_to_image(flow, alpha=0.1, max_flow=25)
```
The function can be found in the flow_utils.py. In our paper, we set the alpha=0.1, max_flow=25.
Any one can download our Flow360 dataset via this link.

# Install
```
python setup.py develop
```

# Pretrained Model
The pretrained model that the paper used can be found there:

Notice that the checkpoints don‘t consist of the CFE, 
considering that CFE is an estimation method, you only need to turn it on while inferring.
